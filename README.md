This app is House recommendation system. Here our program will recommend a house for a user which is close to all the places given.
What we will se from top of google maps is a 2 dimensional earth. So we have made an algorithm that will seperate a list of houses from different places specified. Here we have taken a list of dummy houses and dummy places. Users will also be able to add houses and places DYNAMICALLY and our program will include the newly added houses and places in the houses array and places array respectively.
New calculation of distance will be done based on the newly added places.
For each house, our program will calculate the distance from a particular place. This will be done for all the places and we will calculate the total.
This will be done for all the houses.
The house whose distance is least will be our recommended house.

What you will learn: React Router, CSS, React datasheet.
Here you will learn how to dynamically take an input and store it in an array.

This was built in React Js. Here we have used react datasheet for the purpose of taking an input at a particular box in grid.
